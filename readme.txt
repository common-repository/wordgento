Wordgento uses simple php snippets to return blocks from your Magento installation, these include your Magento:

* CSS/JS
* Includes
* Welcome Message
* Logo
* URL
* Top Links
* Search
* Top Menu
* Wishlist
* Recently Viewed
* Compare
* Sidebar Cart
* Newsletter

Wordgento assumes that the above blocks exist in their usual/default place in Magento, for example - if you are trying to return the sidebar cart in your Wordpress theme, Wordgento will assume that it remains in the sidebar in your Magento theme, and hasn't been moved to the header or anywhere else.

**What's Next for Wordgento?**

The next release will see the ability to enter details of your own custom Magento blocks.

**If upgrading, please back up your database first!**
